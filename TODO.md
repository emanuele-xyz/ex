# TODO

- Implement better logging: support log to a file, and log to console.
- Make assert and crash macros use the logging system
- Use __func__ in macros, not only __FILE__ and __LINE__
- Remove unused source files from vendor\glfw\src
- When assertion fails, log error and then crash.
- Cache shader program uniform indices
